# Scatter Desktop Translations

In order to add translations to Scatter you will need to do the following:
- Create an issue with "Translating: <LANGUAGE>" so that multiple people don't work on the same language at the same time.
- copy `src/languages/english.json` to a new `src/languages/<LANGUAGE>.json` file.
- Change all the texts in that file to match your target language.

Once you have done that you can then issue a Pull Request with the commits.
